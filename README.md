# Welcome to the Pink team's project board

We are currently transitioning some digital services from a private data centre to AWS and this project is where we raise and keep track of our tickets, activity and links to our project resources.

> **Working in the open**
> 
> We favour working in the open and contributing to Open Source projects. However this does come with some restrictions - particularly security related. To enable this approach we need to be careful about what information we include in our tickets, so at times they might seem a bit vague. Also, some of the references to other projects and assets might refer to private content that you won't be able to access unless you have the appropriate permissions.

## Our board

We are implementing the transition using an Agile methodology and as such all of our work is done against tickets.

You can see our current tickets on [our board](https://github.com/UKHomeOffice/dq-aws-migration/projects/1).

### Contributing

While our project board is public, we don't expect anyone other than our project team members to raise tickets on our board. However, if you think you have something interesting or useful to add, please feel free to comment against our tickets.

> We will remove any contributions that are irrelevant or go against our contribution policy
